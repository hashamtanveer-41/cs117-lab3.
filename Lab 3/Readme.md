# Comparison between Registers and Instructions
# Assembly Reflections
Register is small in size, has fast execution and located inside CPU. Register holds data
temporarily and deletes the data after the execution. In assembly language it's relatively 
hard to write the code as compared to python.
It provides the funcionality of a coding languague but in raw and non user freindly way as it is a low level languague.

# Python Reflections
Python has simple syntax which make it easier to learn as compared to other languages.
Python has extensive libraries and same amount of task can be performed by python by writing
very less code as compared to assembly language. 
Abstraction is one of the pillars of OOP's and in python features like symbolic representaion,
use of loops and encapsulation of logic provide flexibility to the users. 
Being a high level languague it allows a more user friendly environment and makes coding more fun.

# Comparison Table

| Feature          | Assembly Example | Python Example | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Variable storage | Register (EAX)   | x = 5          | Assembly store the values in register, for pyton variables are stored in memory|
| Printing output  | INT 21h          | print()        | Assembly direclty interacts with OS, in python we have built in feature  |
| Arithmetic       | ADD AX, BX       | x + y          | Assembly is low level language ,whereas Python is readable |
