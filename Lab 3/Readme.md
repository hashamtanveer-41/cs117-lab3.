# Comparison between Registers and Instructions
# Assembly Reflections
Register is small in size, has fast execution and located inside CPU. Register holds data
temporarily and deletes the data after the execution. In assembly language it's relatively 
hard to write the code as compared to python.

#Python Reflections
Python has simple syntax which make it easier to learn as compared to other languages.
Python has extensive libraries and same amount of task can be performed by python by writing
very less code as compared to assembly language.
